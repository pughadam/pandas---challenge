1.	Males dominate the total percentage of member with ~84% of the total.  However, female consumers spend more ($.40 cents) than men with a higher average price.
Takeaway – look at the female consumer and try to convert more female members as they tend to spend more.
2.	About 76% of people are in the age group of 15 to 29 year old.  The age group of 20 to 24 spend nearly 3x more than any other age group.  
Takeaway – keep those members but deep dive into that age group.  Why are they successful at that age group by that much more than other groups.  Look at attracting younger members especially if the conversion and revenue is so high in the 20 to 24 bucket.
3.	Tope spenders tend to buy the most popular items.
Takeaway – deep dive into those games/items to find best practices.  There may be opportunity to build on that to drive more revenue.
4.	Lastly, by increasing younger people’s interest, you could build brand recognition going into their 20’s (where we are most successful).  Also look at retaining those members for the long haul as they will make more money and have more disposable income going into their 30’s and later.
